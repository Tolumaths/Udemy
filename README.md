# Udemy Project Description

Udemy is an online learning platform that helps students, companies, and governments gain the skills they need to reach their goals. They have over 57 million learners, 213k courses and over 74k instructors.

My mission as a data analyst was to analyse data collected by Udemy and help my manager to better understand the pricing and subscriptions data of Udemy courses (for four different subjects) and identifying trends and patterns and to make smart, data-driven decisions

This analysis helps us to:
- Identify for which subject more courses should be created
- Create targeted strategies to increase the company revenue 

## Key questions:

1. What are the total numbers of subscribers in each subject?
2. How does the average content duration/price/number of students vary across different subjects?
3. How many courses are free and paid for each subject?
4. What is the average price of web development courses at different levels?
5. What are the 20 most popular courses? Also, include the following information:
- Their level
- Whether they are free or paid
- Whether any are free beginner courses,
- and the duration of the courses.
6. Does content duration impact the price of the course?

# Data Design

I have worked on the course sales and trends obtained from Udemy over four (4) different subject areas: Web Development, Graphic Design, Business Finance, and Musical Instruments.

I Identified and removed duplicates, removed blank cells from the data and made clear headers using Google sheets. The clean data was analyzed using Tableau to create necessary visuals. The analysis aims to identify ways to improve Udemyâ€™s business model and increase revenue.
